  <p>Have you ever walked into a coffee shop, stood in line, and realized that the stranger in front of you already paid for your cup of coffee? You sit down and enjoy your same coffee more than any other day. That's exactly what our app does.
 </p>
 <p>Make someone's day brighter with a cup of coffee. We contribute the world by spreading happiness. Suprising some random user of this app with a gift - A CUP OF COFEE!</p>

 <p>It is not amazing?? Surprise the people with this lovely gesture along with a beautiful message. You sure did bring smile on that persons face. Its just one small step towards making this world a little more happier place to live. It encourages people to pass on this lovely gesture forward to any other random user of this app. To be eligible for more suprises you got to surprise someone too. How cool is that!! </p>

 <p>Helping other people with little acts of kindness makes the person happy and it makes the person receiving it feel even better.
 Doing random acts of kindness works as a type of “karma” . When you do random acts of kindness is like adding a good karma in your account. As a result of your good karma something good comes back to you.</p>

Koffee Karma is about giving. At the tap of a button, you can brighten up a random user's day - and your own - by sending them an Offering. What's an Offering? It's a $2.10 ticket that's redeemable for a cup of coffee. If you want, in the time it takes to write a Tweet (or less) you can include a message to personalize your gift as well. Our goal at Koffee Karma is to give everyone an easy, fun and fast way to experience the gift of giving every day.
<br>
<br>
Simply for signing up as a user of Koffee Karma you're eligible to receive one Offering. That's not all - every Offering you send enables you to get one more. Maybe while you're sleeping, maybe during your commute, maybe at the end of a rough day, or even as you wait in line at the coffee shop you might be surprised by a new Offering!
<br>
<br>
Join Koffee Karma and never simply buy coffee again. Turn that common, everyday action into an opportunity to make someone smile instead. Get some good karma by sending out an Offering, and turn in one of your own at the shop.
